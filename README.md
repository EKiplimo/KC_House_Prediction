# House Prediction in King County

### Data
King County House Sales dataset is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

### Overview
A real estate agency in King County, Washington State is looking to explore sales and details on houses in the region to identify various features and factors that significantly contribute to the price of houses. As a Data Scientist, I'll analyze and model the data provided to draw insights and predictions on house prices. 

The following queries will shed some light on house sales and features of an ideal house and a serve as build up for a predictive model:

1. Notable features that contribute to house prices.
2. Is there an observable trend of house sales across the year ?

### Approach
I tried to gain an understanding of the data and identified variables of interest. I cleaned the data by formating columns and dealing with duplicates and null values. Afterwards, I visualised some relationships with our target variable (price) to get a sense of correlation and begun to build regression models upon this.
